# Closure Library Demos

An application made with [Closure Library][closure-library], generated with [Closure Library Generator][closure-library-generator].

The [Closure Library Generator][closure-library-generator] is currently unmaintained.
I spent some time to make things work again.
The the closure compiler in node package is broken. I updated some flags and it's working again.

I added browser-sync to the development cycle to replace grunt livereload.
It can inform the browser to reload the page when watched files have changed.

## Getting Started

```shell
npm install google-closure --save-dev
